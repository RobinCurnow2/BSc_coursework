Various statistical analysises done in my 2nd and 3rd year of my undergraduate degree. 

In BScRcoursework I fit a linear regression model in R to some environmental data. 
In BSc_Regression_Coursework I do some basic data analyses in R on some data relating to Sweedish insurance claims
The final two files relate to a piece of coursework in a course on Generalized linear models. The data analysed relates to child bith weights and the factors that may affect it being born underweight.. Unfortunately, I do not have the data used in this analysis. The script and report are uploaded here to only show the methods used.
